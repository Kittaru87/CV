**Junior Full Stack Web Developer in training**

Current student at the inimitable Makers Academy, following a nine year career working as webmaster then digital content manager for a finance charity. I am looking for new challenges that allow me to expand my programming knowledge and skills.

## Profile

Changing careers is not an easy thing to do. However you can spend so long in a role that tasks become predictable and your job no longer excites you. I needed a change of tack. Then I found programming! What started as a couple of online courses in my spare time led to a 3 month evening course, which then led to Makers, a 16-week intensive dev bootcamp. And I am loving every second of it.

My professional training includes pair programming and test-driven development (TDD), and incorporates front- and back-end development. It is both fast paced and constantly evolving, conditions that I thrive in - the more there is to learn, the better.

I look forward to taking the skills I already have and those I will learn and applying them to any project that comes my way. Most of all I look forward to working with like-minded people who feel passionate about coding and with whom I can take the next step in my career.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Skills

**Adaptable and thrives under pressure**

I've always enjoyed taking on new things, and have often had to adapt my current position in order to accomodate extra work. A few years back we undertook a large website migration to a new Drupal CMS which I was co-ordinating alongside the old and new developers. Unfortunately for us the old developers went into administration as this process was happening and despite the promise that all our archived data was safe, it turned out not to be the case. I moved to a new system that threw up over 20,000 errors when I ran it through Webmaster tools (Google Search Console). Not only did I have to learn how to be administrator to a new CMS but I had to debug and relink our entire site while trying to hunt down an entire library of documents. I did it and our website has since gone on to be the most successful it has ever been.

**Attention to detail**

It is important to be able to spot mistakes, especially when it comes to code. My previous roles have always required an eye for detail and the ability to quickly pick up on spelling, grammatical or formatting errors. As sub-editor to 2 trade magazines this means not only proofing the documents but also rewriting large swathes of text, including reordering or compacting articles in order to better fit the page. This is a skill I feel translates well into the world of programming, not only for debugging but also refactoring of code.

**Efficient**

One of the managers at my previous job was once asked how she would describe me in one word and turns out that word was 'efficient'. I am able to take on numerous roles at one time (SEO, digital content, website management, administrative support) because of my ability to find the simplest, most productive way of achieving my goals.

**Takes the initiative**

Once I had an inkling that software engineering was the path I wanted to take, I immediately set about making that happen alongside my day job and freelance work. Not only have I attended an evening web development course as well as undertaken online courses but I've also sat down with a number of friends already in the industry to pair programme with and to pick their brains on best practice and what their expectations are for junior developers. I've also helped a couple of my friends with their websites (mostly SEO), which has allowed me more experience with different CMSs, and have started building a website for an ex-colleague for her new business. Learning by doing will compliment what I learn at Makers and look foward to building up my own portfolio.
