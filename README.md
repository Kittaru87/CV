## Sophia Bell

**Junior Full Stack Web Developer**

Graduate of the inimitable Makers Academy, following a nine year career working as webmaster then digital content manager for a finance professional body. I am looking for new challenges that allow me to expand my programming knowledge and skills.

## Profile

Changing careers is not an easy thing to do. However you can spend so long in a role that tasks become predictable and your job no longer excites you. I needed a change of tack. Then I found programming! What started as a couple of online courses in my spare time led to a 3 month evening course, which then led to Makers, a 16-week intensive dev bootcamp. And I am loving every second of it.

My professional training includes pair programming and test-driven development (TDD), and incorporates front- and back-end development. It is both fast paced and constantly evolving, conditions that I thrive in - the more there is to learn, the better.

I look forward to taking the skills I already have and those I will learn and applying them to any project that comes my way. Most of all I look forward to working with like-minded people who feel passionate about coding and with whom I can take the next step in my career.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, JQuery, HTML, CSS, SQL, Postgres, NodeJS

**Testing**: RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara

**Linting**: Rubocop, ESlint, Simplecov

## Skills

**Adaptable and thrives under pressure**

Part of the process of being a Maker is being able to adapt your learning to whatever project, learning tool or pair partner you are working with that week. This was especially the case during our final project. The easy thing to do would have been to pick a subject and framework we were familiar with, however wanting to continue our learning and see how far we could push ourselves, we opted to use two things we had very little experience with, APIs and React. The learning curve was steep as we had less than 2 weeks to completion, but we were able to put together a project that utilises a React frontend and Rails backend to interact with the Spotify API. We continually adapted our design to take into account time constraints and used Agile methodologies thoughout.

**Teamwork**

Project work, by far, has been the most enjoyable aspect of my time at Makers. I work well when bouncing ideas off of other people, enjoy listening to and understanding other people's way of thinking that is different to my own, and ultimately producing something that is an amalgamation of everyone's ideas and efforts. I took part in 3 big projects - cloning Airbnb, cloning Facebook, and then my final project - and I learned something new and exciting in each of those experiences, whether that was how to apply bootstrap, learning how to use React or how not to get mixed up between Rails 5 and Rails 6!

**Takes the initiative**

Once I had an inkling that software engineering was the path I wanted to take, I immediately set about making that happen alongside my day job and freelance work. Not only have I attended an evening web development course as well as undertaken online courses but I've also sat down with a number of friends already in the industry to pair program with and to pick their brains on best practice and what their expectations are for junior developers. Since leaving Makers I've started my own projects, both solo and with other junior developers, in order to continue my learning journey.

**Attention to detail**

It is important to be able to spot mistakes, especially when it comes to code. My previous roles have always required an eye for detail and the ability to quickly pick up on spelling, grammatical or formatting errors. As sub-editor to 2 trade magazines this means not only proofing the documents but also rewriting large swathes of text, including reordering or compacting articles in order to better fit the page. This is a skill I feel translates well into the world of programming, not only for debugging but also refactoring of code.
